### Technologies used:

1. NextJS
2. Typescript
3. Local Storage
4. Tailwind for styling

###  Known Limitations or Future Improvements:

1. Add the ability to edit a task, editing the description or the title.
2. Add a date when a task is completed
3. Use other storage methods beside local storage
4. On Kanban View add the ability where tasks can be dragged from "Not started" to "In Progress" for example.
5. Mobile responsiveness needs improvement as well in the future.
